        Rinka was always interested in art, making sure that most of her
        priority was set into doing her art and following her passion for it.
        Now, she sits at her desk drawing on a tablet and drinking bottles of
        pepsi max all day long. Not exactly what you'd think she wants to do,
        but she enjoys it very much.

          Ello Ello, I don't have much to put here besides the fact that I am
          not on a whole lot, but when I usually get on it'll be for alonger
          period of time.
